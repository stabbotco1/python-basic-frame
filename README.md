# Python Basic Frame

A basic Python starting framework, bash-based, featuring a menu system and logging.

## Introduction

This project serves as a starting point for those new to Python, providing a simple framework that includes a bash-based menu system and basic logging functionality. It has been built by someone new to Python and the "Pythonic" way of doing things, aiming to share with others who are just getting started and might appreciate a foundational project.

**Note:** This is a semi-opinionated take on building a starting bash-based app. There may be anti-patterns present, and suggestions are welcome.

**Enjoy!**
